### üì¢ New Release for Windows & macOS Desktop, Welcome to Test and Provide Feedback [Documentation is a bit outdated and will be updated continuously]

 ## Project Introduction  

Krillin AI is an all-in-one audio and video localization and enhancement solution. This minimalist yet powerful tool integrates video translation, dubbing, and voice cloning, supporting both landscape and portrait format outputs, ensuring perfect presentation on all major platforms (Bilibili, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, WeChat Video, Kuaishou, YouTube, TikTok, etc.). With an end-to-end workflow, Krillin AI can transform raw materials into beautifully ready-to-use cross-platform content with just a few clicks.

## Key Features and Functions:
üéØ **One-Click Start**: No complex environment configuration required, automatic dependency installation, ready to use immediately, with a new desktop version for more convenience!

üì• **Video Acquisition**: Supports downloading via yt-dlp or local file uploads

üìú **Accurate Recognition**: High-accuracy speech recognition based on Whisper

üß† **Intelligent Segmentation**: Subtitle segmentation and alignment using LLM

üîÑ **Terminology Replacement**: One-click replacement of professional vocabulary 

üåç **Professional Translation**: LLM-based, paragraph-level translation maintaining semantic coherence

üéôÔ∏è **Voice Cloning**: Offers selected voice tones from CosyVoice or custom voice cloning

üé¨ **Video Composition**: Automatically handles landscape and portrait video and subtitle layout


## Effect Display
The image below shows the effect of the subtitle file generated after importing a 46-minute local video and executing it with one click, without any manual adjustments. There are no omissions or overlaps, the sentence breaks are natural, and the translation quality is very high.

## Interface Preview
![Interface Preview](/docs/images/ui_desktop.png)


## üöÄ Quick Start
### Basic Steps
First, download the executable file that matches your device system from the [Release](https://github.com/krillinai/KrillinAI/releases), then follow the tutorial below to choose between the desktop version or non-desktop version, and place it in an empty folder. Download the software into an empty folder because it will generate some directories after running, making it easier to manage.

„ÄêIf it is the desktop version, i.e., the release file with "desktop," see here„Äë  
_The desktop version is newly released to address the issue of new users having difficulty correctly editing configuration files, and there are still some bugs that are continuously being updated._
1. Double-click the file to start using it (the desktop version also requires configuration within the software)

„ÄêIf it is the non-desktop version, i.e., the release file without "desktop," see here„Äë  
_The non-desktop version is the initial version, with a more complex configuration, but stable functionality, suitable for server deployment, as it provides a UI in a web manner._
1. Create a `config` folder within the directory, then create a `config.toml` file in the `config` folder, copy the content of the `config-example.toml` file from the source code's `config` directory into `config.toml`, and fill in your configuration information accordingly.
2. Double-click or execute the executable file in the terminal to start the service 
3. Open a browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:8888` to start using it (replace 8888 with the port you filled in the configuration file)

### To: macOS Users
„ÄêIf it is the desktop version, i.e., the release file with "desktop," see here„Äë  
Currently, due to signing issues, the desktop version cannot be run directly by double-clicking or installed via dmg; you need to manually trust the application. The method is as follows:
1. Open the terminal in the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64) is located
2. Execute the following commands in order:
```
sudo xattr -cr ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64 
./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
```

„ÄêIf it is the non-desktop version, i.e., the release file without "desktop," see here„Äë  
This software is not signed, so when running on macOS, after completing the file configuration in the "Basic Steps," you also need to manually trust the application. The method is as follows:
1. Open the terminal in the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64) is located
2. Execute the following commands in order:
   ```
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    ```
    This will start the service

### Docker Deployment
This project supports Docker deployment; please refer to the [Docker Deployment Instructions](./docker.md)

### Cookie Configuration Instructions (Optional)

If you encounter issues with video downloads

Please refer to the [Cookie Configuration Instructions](./get_cookies.md) to configure your Cookie information.

### Configuration Help (Must Read)
The quickest and easiest configuration method:
* Set both `transcription_provider` and `llm_provider` to `openai`, so you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` in the three configuration categories below: `openai`, `local_model`, and `aliyun` for subtitle translation. (`app.proxy`, `model`, and `openai.base_url` can be filled in as needed)

Using a local language recognition model (not yet supported on macOS) configuration method (balancing cost, speed, and quality):
* Set `transcription_provider` to `fasterwhisper` and `llm_provider` to `openai`, so you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` and `local_model.faster_whisper` in the three configuration categories below: `openai` and `local_model` for subtitle translation, and the local model will be downloaded automatically. (`app.proxy` and `openai.base_url` as above)

For the following usage scenarios, Aliyun configuration is required:
* If `llm_provider` is set to `aliyun`, you need to use Aliyun's large model service, so you need to configure the `aliyun.bailian` item.
* If `transcription_provider` is set to `aliyun`, or if the "Dubbing" feature is enabled when starting a task, you need to use Aliyun's speech service, so you need to fill in the `aliyun.speech` item.
* If the "Dubbing" feature is enabled and you have uploaded local audio for voice cloning, you will also need to use Aliyun's OSS cloud storage service, so you need to fill in the `aliyun.oss` item.
